## Introduction
Sometimes a Web API is used interchangeably with a Web Service, 

## Background

### Web application
A web application is both a clientside by part and server-side by part application effort for a whole complete service.

### Web APIs
We have client-side Web API and server-side Web API. Client side Web API's usually refer to frameworks offering 
Application Programming interface, usually not the core browser engine APIs, unless they are publicly accesible.
Server-side web API is the request-response message system interfac, usually based off the obvious HTTP-based webserver. 

### Mashups vs Portals
Mashups are web applications that serve services from more than one web servers. Such services are often in complement to main r major 
web application server. More often these mashups are publich or open APIs offered by the various development communities.

###Webhooks
Web hooks are the event callbacks on the events that occur on a web appplication server. Usually tthesse callbacks are served by thrid party services or
the same web apllication but probably using a remote application server part the their mashup.

###Endpoints
Endpoints are the specific resource locations that offer each or a collection of web application servers services. Usually these are the **URI** on which HTTP req-resp are made.
